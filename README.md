# Stuff I looked up this week

I look stuff up all the time for lots of different reasons. I'm going to try to keep track of it. 

## 2017

* _permille_ ‚Ä∞: I don't know how I've been a type nerd this long and never come across the permille, or indeed thought harder about the components of the word "per-_cent_" :flushed: Of course it only has one 0 in the divisor! Oy.

   Came across it in [The Loveliest Living Fossil](https://www.typography.com/blog/the-loveliest-living-fossil) by Jonathan Hoefler.
* [Monument to the Third International (Tatlin's Tower)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatlin%27s_Tower): listening to an episode of [No Such Thing as a Fish](http://qi.com/podcast), this tower came up and I couldn't remember ever hearing about it or having seen it. The hosts on NSTAAF remarked on its double-helix design predating the discovery of DNA's structure by several decades, but what I find interesting is [this discussion about spirals](https://thecharnelhouse.org/2015/03/24/tatlins-tower/) and how they relate to/function as a metaphor for the repetition of capitalism. Huh!

* _Boricua_: a Puerto Rican, especially one living in the United States. 
   Listening to [Code Switch](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/07/26/539368829/stretch-bobbito-on-race-hip-hop-and-belonging) last weekend, Bobbito reminded me I've heard this word a bunch of times (like in the middle of ["Jenny from the Block"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dly6p4Fu5TE#t=3m5s)!) and always forget to look it up, but this time I remembered!
   
   Mystery solved! (:

* I always mix up which type of soil produces blue and pink hydrangeas, [Farmer's Almanac to the rescue](https://www.almanac.com/plant/hydrangea)! Low pH below 5.5 (acidic): blue; higher pH over 5.5 (more base): pink. (White flowered hydrangeas aren't affected by the soil's pH.)


### 31 July‚Äì04 August

* Subaru's "pzev" badge on their vehicles (was behind one this morning on the way to work). Ah, "partial zero emissions vehicle".
   - [What is a PZEV?](https://www.thoughtco.com/pzev-partial-zero-emissions-vehicle-85335)
   
      > PZEVs run on gasoline, yet offer extremely clean emissions with zero evaporative emissions.
   - Origin story: California's zero emission vehicles mandate, PZEVs are a compromise (and hard to type correctly).
   - Heh, one of the other sources I found was mostly a huffy rant about the California Air Resources Board, sooo no link for them.

* [HTMLHint](https://github.com/yaniswang/HTMLHint/wiki/About): saw it in a commit for a big upcoming project.
 ¬† - That about statement is‚Ä¶¬†it could be better, but I like the way they're using the repo's wiki for the documentation. üëç
* [Transpiling ES6](https://css-tricks.com/transpiling-es6/): ran through their Babel section just to see how it does things.
   - We end up in such weird places with the names of related / similar tools: Gulp, Brocoli, Brunch. Honestly.
* [**heteroglossia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroglossia) from the phrase "a heteroglossic wonderland" (which goes straight on to [the band name list](https://github.com/dotsara/is-the-name/blob/master/README.md)).

   The intro on this isn't as good as it could be, but I think this bit in the first section gets at the meat in heteroglossia (and provides support for the relationship to code switching):
   
   > Extending his argument, Bakhtin proposes that all languages represent a distinct point of view on the world, characterized by its own meaning and values. In this view, language is "shot through with intentions and accents" (1981: 324), and thus there are no neutral words. Even the most unremarkable statement possesses a taste, whether of a profession, a party, a generation, a place or a time. To Bakhtin, words do not exist until they are spoken, and that moment they are printed with the signature of the speaker.
   >
   > Bakhtin identifies the act of speech, or of writing, as a literary-verbal performance, one that requires speakers or authors to take a position, even if only by choosing the dialect in which they will speak.

* Google search: "github markdown code wrap"
   I've always hated that code blocks in Markdown with long lines scroll out of view; occasionally, I'll break them manually, but sometimes I'm saving code that I don't understand, so I'd rather _not_. Anyway, apparently it's not a thing. üôÑ Well, it's a thing with a browser extension, but it's not a built-in thing, yet.
   * [how to line wrap long lines inside markdown code blocks in github & gitlab issues? (StackOverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41238148/how-to-line-wrap-long-lines-inside-markdown-code-blocks-in-githubgitlab)
   * [github-pre-utility](https://github.com/yoheimuta/github-pre-utility)
* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è related! [linguist `languages.yml`](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml): GitHub uses Linguist to detect languages & do the syntax highlighting, this is the list of which keywords are valid.

* **proprioception**: "‚Ä¶is the sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception)), from [Digging Deeper: Stretching](https://www.elitefts.com/education/rehab-recovery/digging-deeper-stretching/)
* `pushInsteadOf`, `insteadOf` in a coworker's `~/.gitconfig`: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#git-config-urlltbasegtinsteadOf
   - I'm not sure I interact with open-source repos often enough for this to be useful for me, but still, nifty.
